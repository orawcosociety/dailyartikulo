      <p class="lead" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px; text-align: justify;">‎How does a president defend a legacy when public trust is slipping halfway through his term?
      <p class="lead" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px; text-align: justify;">‎‎President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. delivered his fourth State of the Nation Address on July 28, 2025, under a different climate—not just of storms and floods, but of political reality. Midterm losses, widespread criticism, and public discontent shaped the backdrop of a speech that, for the first time, admitted dissatisfaction rather than denied it.
	  <p class="lead" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px; text-align: justify;">‎From infrastructure pledges to social service updates, the speech resembled previous ones in form, but the tone was less celebratory. One moment stood out: “Mahiya naman kayo.” Directed at corrupt and negligent public officials, it was a rare public condemnation that drew applause—but also raised questions. Why, three years into the term, is the president still calling out dysfunction instead of reporting its resolution?
      <p class="lead" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px; text-align: justify;">‎The administration’s grand projects were repeated: the Bataan-Cavite Interlink Bridge, ₱20 per kilo rice, digital transformation, expanded PhilHealth coverage, and classroom construction. These were all presented as signs of progress. But behind the statistics, basic services remain patchy. As of July, over six million Filipinos still lack access to clean water, and three million households remain without electricity. Marcos admitted this himself.
	  <p class="lead" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px; text-align: justify;">‎‎The president also highlighted the ARAL recovery program and the rollout of BUCAS diagnostic centers. But critics noted that funding for these programs is stretched thin, and local governments have complained about the delays. The public Wi-Fi expansion—from 4,000 to nearly 19,000 sites—was mentioned, yet internet quality remains unreliable in many provinces.
      <p class="lead" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px; text-align: justify;">‎‎Perhaps the most revealing part of the address was what it tried to deflect: accountability. The call for cabinet secretaries to resign after the administration’s poor midterm performance was framed as a “reset.” But it was also a silent admission of failure. Marcos asked for unity, but not responsibility. Corruption in flood-control projects was condemned, yet no names were mentioned, and no timelines were set for prosecutions. The phrase “Mahiya naman kayo” landed harder than expected—because it came from the same government that allowed these officials to stay this long.
      <p class="lead" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px; text-align: justify;">‎‎‎The 2025 SONA captured a government walking the line between public promise and political survival. Marcos spoke of ambition, but the country heard fatigue. The applause in the chamber could not drown out the unrest in the streets or the disillusionment that echoed from communities still waiting for basic services. After three years of power, the Marcos administration is not short on plans—but it is still short on proof.
