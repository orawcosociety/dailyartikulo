      <h1 class="headline" style="font-family: Arial; font-size:28px; margin-up: 0px;">The Real POV of Pacman: Hopes to His Fists</h1>

      <p class="lead" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; text-align: justify;">Before all the fame, the light, and the roaring crowds, there was just a boy—skinny, barefoot, and full of dreams. With fists wrapped in hope and a heart that never gave up.
      <p class="upper-body" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; text-align: justify;">Life did not hand Manny a golden start. He was born into poverty, where he was raised. In a small home, and rice was a struggle to afford. As a child, just to survive a day, the least he can do is help his mother sell some goods. But deep inside, he carried something powerful. 
<p class="body" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; text-align: justify;">He wasn’t raised with comfort but with courage. At the age of 14 years old, he independently made his own bold choice to leave home, and with determination, Manny was training while other kids were just playing.
<p class="middle" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; text-align: justify;">He trained very hard, fought for his dreams, and never gave up; he was not just hitting an opponent, but also he was fighting for hardship, hopelessness, and struggles in life. It wasn’t long enough, and the world took notice of his potential, and his name echoed and became famous across continents. As years passed by, he became the first and only boxer to win world titles in eight different. He made history by becoming the only boxer to win world titles in eight weight divisions.
<p class="tail" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; text-align: justify;">He showed us that being a champion isn’t just about winning inside the ring; it’s about lifting others up and remembering where you came from. Manny Pacquiao’s story is not just one of success. It is living proof that even the poorest child can rise to greatness as long as he dreams, believes, and keeps on fighting.
