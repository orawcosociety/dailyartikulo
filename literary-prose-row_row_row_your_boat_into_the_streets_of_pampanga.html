      <p class="lead" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; text-align: justify;">“Flood, flood, go away... Let our homes be safe today.”
      <p class="lead" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; text-align: justify;">This simple line, often sung by children during rainy days, has now become a desperate plea from the people of Pampanga. What was just another rainy season turned into a nightmare as floodwaters rose, swallowing communities whole and shaking lives.
      <p class="lead" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; text-align: justify;">In July 2025, the Philippines once again reached its peak typhoon season. No region, community, or family has been spared from the effects of the monsoon. But for the people of Pampanga, this year's floods have brought an unimaginable level of destruction.
      <p class="lead" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; text-align: justify;">Water crept into homes slowly at first, then rapidly, forcing families to evacuate with nothing but the clothes on their backs. Streets turned into rivers, and classrooms into evacuation centers. Livelihoods were drowned, rice fields, sari-sari stores, even livestock—all gone in a matter of days.
      <p class="lead" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; text-align: justify;">Yet in the face of it all, something stronger than the floodwaters rose: the spirit of the Kapampangan people. Volunteers braved the currents to deliver food. Strangers shared roof space with displaced families. Youths helped carry the elderly through waist-deep water. Despite the tears and tired bodies, the will to survive and rebuild is there.
      <p class="lead" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; text-align: justify;">This disaster reminds us not only of nature’s power, but of the urgent need to strengthen disaster preparedness, improve drainage systems, and prioritize the voices of the affected. The flood is not just a natural event—it also reflects how support and planning have been missing for a long time.
      <p class="lead" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; text-align: justify;">As the skies clear and the waters slowly retreat, what remains is the will of the people who were all ready to sacrifice everything for their loved ones.
      <p class="lead" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; text-align: justify;">Homes still stand—held up by hope, built on resilience.
      <p class="lead" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; text-align: justify;">“Merrily, Merrily, Merrily, Merrily... Flood isn’t a dream.”
